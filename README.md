Purpose: To display when the next train will arrive and to alert people when to leave office to catch trains on time.

Description: 
This Android app displays the time to next two train’s arrival based on the user’s input to line, station, and direction of train.

Based on information input by user, the app will send a notification when it is time to go so that the user can catch the next available train.  If the user does not want to take the current train, he/she can choose to skip this current train and the app will notify again when the next train is available. Otherwise, the user can choose to dismiss the notification altogether and the app will stop notification until the next day. 

Manual: 
In the main page, user will see the station, direction, line, time of next and the one after next coming train, estimate walking time from working place to subway station and time to leave for the station. 
By clicking each arrow corresponding to each value, user can jump to another setting page and set all these values shown on the main page. 

Using the station setting as an example – after clicking on the station button that shows BackBay, it will jump to the view where user can select options by scrolling the spinners and set the station the user wants to take to go home, subway direction, and the line. When all thing is done, user can click CONFIRM to save these choices. And the page will jump back to the home page.

After setting all the values, user is free to start his or her work and our software will warn the user based on the time he or she is off work, train arrival time, time needed to get to the station. By sending notification to users phone, our software will tell user it’s time to leave. User can choose to dismiss this message or skip it. If user clicks DISMISS, the software starts the alarm tomorrow. If user clicks SKIP, the software will send another notification when our software thinks it is right time to leave for the train.
